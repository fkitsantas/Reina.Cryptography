## Project Overview
Reina Cryptography is a state-of-the-art class library for .NET and .NET Framework, meticulously designed to offer advanced Cascading Triple-Layered Encryption and Decryption capabilities, along with internal key management functionalities. Focusing on security and ease of use, the library provides seamless integration with Azure Key Vault. This integration is activated during the encryption or decryption processes to automatically fetch the appropriate 256-bit encryption key(s) stored in Azure Key Vault under the keyname(s) provided by the developer for Encryption/Decryption. If such key(s) do not exist in Azure Key Vault, the library creates new unique 256-bit encryption key(s) and stores them in Azure Key Vault under the specified keyname(s).
